# MyMovieList

A simple program that allows users to create an account or login, and allows them to review movies, view their reviews, view others reviews, and search for a movie on IMDB

## To Run
You need to create a text file named "keys.txt" in the folder with the program. The first line of the file should be your rapid API key and the second should be your IMDB-API key.
